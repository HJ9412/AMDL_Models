The *.py files uploaded in each folder is adapting the dependent learning technique to another version of evaluator.

Even though this evaluator takes two inputs(x1 for original and x2 for reconstructed),
the presented design intentionally makes it difficult to distinguish
between the original(x1) and the reconstructed(x2), as it is the case in the double slit experiment.

(Maybe I have needed to mix layers once more to make parameters truly intermingled and depended.)

I hope this design solves the concern that the original evaluator would have been biased to the data from reconstruction.
