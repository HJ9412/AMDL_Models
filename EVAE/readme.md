The *.py files uploaded in each folder is adapting the dependent learning technique to another version of evaluator.

This new evaluator takes two inputs(one for original and one for reconstructed),

while the presented design intentionally makes it difficult for the machine to distinguish
between the original(x1) and the reconstructed(x2), as it is the case in the double slit experiment.

(Maybe I have needed to mix layers once more to make parameters truly intermingled and depended.)
