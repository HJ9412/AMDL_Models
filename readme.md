The folder EVAE(enhanced VAE) contains few models that are exhibiting a pre-trained incorporated version of a VAE with an evaluator network.

You may find some samples in screenshot folder.

The code at the main folder is presenting a prototypical structure of the evaluator network, which is totally unsupervised, only dependent to VAE.

You can download and run the model through the *.ipynb files provided in the AMDL_Models/EVAE. There are metadata files in *.png as well.

Various models will be uploaded afterword.
